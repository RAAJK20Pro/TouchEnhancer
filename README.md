# TouchEnhancer

TouchEnhancer improves touch response, UI smoothness, Display Visual and overall device fluidity.

Includes:
• Touch & gesture responsiveness boost
• Frame timing & UI pipeline tuning
• SurfaceFlinger duration & vsync tweaks
• Optional kernel-level enhancements
• Full boot-time logging for debugging

Compatible with Magisk/KSU . Safe and reversible.
